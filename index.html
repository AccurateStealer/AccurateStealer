                    <p>
                        I enjoy programming games and creating engaging mechanics. I am 
                        interesting in learning new skills and adding to my knowledge.
                        I have created a variety of projects in Unity 3D including Virtual Reality Games.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have experience in C#, 3D environments, and VR.</p>

                            <p>This is a VR game based around creating a potion. You must complete a series
                                of puzzles to gain the different ingredients required to make the final potion.</p>
                            <p>This is my first full project using a VR environment. It was created in
                                Untiy using the XR Interation Toolkit and programmed in C#.</p>

                            <p>This VR experience was created to learn the basics of VR development in unity.
                                The aim is to complete an obstacle course and throw a ball through a hoop to gain two trophies.
                                It utilises both teleportation and contiunous movement and allows you to interact with different objects.
